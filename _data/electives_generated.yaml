    description: The course uses design as a vehicle for examining technology and
      society interaction, particularly how we design, create, and choose technology.
      Design and Society has been created to introduce students to various methods
      to help them view design and technology from a technology-society perspective.
      The overriding aims of the course are to (a) develop an ability to see through
      the eyes of others and promote thinking about technology in terms of users as
      well as producers or creators, (b) develop critical thinking skills, and (c)
      present design and the choice of technology as an activity involving societal
      and individual concerns rather than as a purely technical matter. The course
      does not require advanced technical knowledge and is open to students of all
      faculties.

    description: Biotechnologies are currently migrating from the laboratory to a
      wide range of consumer products. In everything from foods to pharmaceuticals,
      genetic engineering is entering daily life. The biotechnology revolution will
      likely have as much of an impact on our lives as the information technology
      revolution. However, there is a wide and potentially dangerous gap between research
      and development on the one hand and societal awareness of its impact on the
      other. This course is intended to help students gain a deeper appreciation for
      the issues, including ethics, surrounding biotechnology and society. It will
      do this through an investigation of such interactions between biotechnologies
      and society as genetics and the law, foods and the media, and soil remediation
      and the environment. Consideration will also be given to the role of computing
      in biotech research and in the human genome project.
